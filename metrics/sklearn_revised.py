    """Compute average precision (AP) from prediction scores

    AP summarizes a precision-recall curve as the weighted mean of precisions
    achieved at each threshold, with the increase in recall from the previous
    threshold used as the weight:

    .. math::
        \\text{AP} = \\sum_n (R_n - R_{n-1}) P_n

    where :math:`P_n` and :math:`R_n` are the precision and recall at the nth
    threshold [1]_. This implementation is not interpolated and is different
    from computing the area under the precision-recall curve with the
    trapezoidal rule, which uses linear interpolation and can be too
    optimistic.

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task
    or multilabel classification task.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        True binary labels or binary label indicators.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).

    average : string, [None, 'micro', 'macro' (default), 'samples', 'weighted']
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        this determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
            indicator matrix as a label.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average.

        Will be ignored when ``y_true`` is binary.

    pos_label : int or str (default=1)
        The label of the positive class. Only applied to binary ``y_true``.
        For multilabel-indicator ``y_true``, ``pos_label`` is fixed to 1.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    average_precision : float

    """Compute precision-recall pairs for different probability thresholds

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample
    that is negative.

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    The last precision and recall values are 1. and 0. respectively and do not
    have a corresponding threshold.  This ensures that the graph starts on the
    y axis.

    Parameters

        When ``pos_label=None``, if y_true is in {-1, 1} or {0, 1},

    -------
    precision : array, shape = [n_thresholds + 1]

    recall : array, shape = [n_thresholds + 1]
        Decreasing recall values such that element i is the recall of
